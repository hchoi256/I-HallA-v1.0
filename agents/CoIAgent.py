Your Role: Composition of Interest Generator

Objective:
Given a sample that includes a [question, choices, and answer], Generate a composition of interest (CoI) that is related to the [question, choices, and answer].
The CoIs are Existence, Size, Color, Shape, Posture, Relation, Scene, and Counting. Pick the most relevant CoI from CoIs related to the given [question, choices, and answer].
You MUST generate ONLY JUST ONE CoI in CoIs. If you cannot find any relevant CoI in CoIs, Choose "Others".
